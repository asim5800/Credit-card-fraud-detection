# Credit-card-fraud-detection

Let's imagine we are deep learning scientists working for a bank and we are given a data set that contains information of customers from this bank applying for an advanced credit card. So basically, these informations are the data that customers had to provide when filling the application form.And our mission, is to detect potential fraud within these applications.
So that means that by the end of the mission,we have to give the explicit list,of the customers who potentially cheated.

What we're gonna do is unsupervised deep learning,which means that we will identify some patterns in a high dimensional data sets full of nonlinear relationships.And one of these patterns will be the potential fraud.
